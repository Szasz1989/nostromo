precommit hooks (lint, doc)
generate docs from docblock
testrunner: keepalive flag: stop execution and browser on first error (exit/continue on request)
testrunner: handle ctrl+c gracefully (exit browser, stop servers, etc)
replace all string command names with const definitions
minify dist js (-comments)
mutation observer autotest: show dialog & focus on it
document capturedEvent with $fullSelectorPath, $timestamp, etc
nth: use rfr in tests
change test ports (recorderApp, puppeteer)
throw a big fat error if browser executable wasn't found
assert downloaded files?

update examples
    - (default) before/after assert

update tests
    - afterLastCommand
    - before/after assert
    - per-test and per-run bailout

testrunner should survive browser restarts
configurable assert keys
customizable assert
fully handle all change events (checkbox, file)

recorder debug view: last click (?) full selector path, unique path

default* callbacks: not really necessary? e.g.
    function defaultBeforeXY()...
    'beforeXY: defaultBeforeXY' everywhere

ability to define global default timeouts (waitFor/WhileVisible, etc) in run.conf

BUGS:
SBV error if selector is visible when starting page (fixed?)
