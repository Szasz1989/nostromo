~precommit hooks (lint, doc)~ better: CI
test per-test and per-run bailout
testrunner: keepalive flag: stop execution and browser on first error (exit/continue on request)
testrunner: handle ctrl+c gracefully (exit browser, stop servers, etc)
replace all string command names with const definitions
minify dist js (-comments)
mutation observer autotest: show dialog & focus on it
document capturedEvent with $fullSelectorPath, $timestamp, etc
nth: use rfr in tests
change test ports (recorderApp, puppeteer)
throw a big fat error if browser executable wasn't found
ability to compare downloaded files to a filesystem file?

update examples
    - before/after assert
    - etc

update tests
    - afterLastCommand
    - before/after assert
    - per-test and per-run bailout

testrunner should survive browser restarts
configurable assert keys
customizable asserter
fully handle all change events (checkbox, file)

recorder debug view: last click (?) full selector path, unique path

ability to define global default timeouts (waitFor/WhileVisible, etc) in run.conf

explanation to each callback fn (e.g. beforeTest: runs before the appUrl is opened)
    - flowchart?

BUGS:
SBV error if selector is visible when starting page (fixed?)

single nostromo installation should rec/run multiple branches, e.g. define folders in conf.js, etc.

record multiple selector paths (like selenium), for robustness
* trivial: full path
* reduced unique paths

fully configure from cmd?

separate macro recorder from project
* universal json output, pluggable converters
* add timestamps
