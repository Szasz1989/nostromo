precommit hooks (lint, doc)
generate docs from docblock
create referenceErrors folder on-demand
test per-test and per-run bailout
testrunner: keepalive flag: stop execution and browser on first error (exit/continue on request)
testrunner: handle ctrl+c gracefully (exit browser, stop servers, etc)
replace all string command names with const definitions
minify dist js (-comments)
mutation observer autotest: show dialog & focus on it
document capturedEvent with $fullSelectorPath, $timestamp, etc
nth: use rfr in tests
change test ports (recorderApp, puppeteer)
find browser path automatically
throw a big fat error if browser executable wasn't found
assert downloaded files?
vector-based assertion?

recorder, testrunner should survive browser restarts
move composite events logic to config

SBV error if selector is visible when starting page
